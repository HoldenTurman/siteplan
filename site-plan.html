      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        As a musician I have always loved to create. Normally for me that is in the form of melodies and lyrics. However when I found out the possibilities you have to create with software development I was really blown away and very intrigued! Web Development is similar to music in a lot of ways. You take a simple idea and with small little pokes here and there, you soon have something quite amazing!
